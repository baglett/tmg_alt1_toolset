The tests do not currently have a pass/fail system in place, it is mostly just a tool for easy development

```sh
# run to compile the libraries each time you save
npm run watch
# in a second terminal run
npm run tests
```

This will open your browser with some different test options.
Click the test name of interest and open the browser devtools/console to see what's going on
